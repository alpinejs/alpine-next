Ducie,

This year was a bit different for us. Loootttttaaaa time alone inside, but we crushed it.

Thanks for being the best quarantine buddy ever.

I never get sick of hanging with you Duce. We're best friends. It's kinda wild.

Thanks for also being the best wife ever. You care so much for me. You help out around the apartment in all the ways I slack off on.

We can watch the same shows now! Woohoo! Thanks for stretching yourself to do and watch non-family friendly things with me. You're a badass. You're bitchin'.

Another year has passed, every one is better than the last and I mean that so much.

I just love you so much,
Your K Bean Nan Duce
